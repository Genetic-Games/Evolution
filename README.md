## Evolution

Evolution is the proud first game release by Genetic Games! Through the eye piece of a microscope, you aim to witness evolution of a wily bacteria first-hand.

This top-down 2D single player game puts you in the driver seat behind a single mutated bacteria hell-bent on being nothing short of the fittest to survive in the whole, wide petri dish. 

Try your hand at Evolution today and grow to become a legend larger than life, and maybe even bigger than Charles Darwin himself!
